## How Bantay Paws began

Bantay Paws started as a small circle of friends responding to late-night calls about dogs in distress. What began with borrowed crates and home-cooked rice has grown into a community-powered rescue that runs transports, fosters, and medical care across the Philippines.

### What keeps us moving

- **Rescue:** Field pickups for abandoned or injured dogs, often in hard-to-reach areas.  
- **Rehab:** Vet care, nutrition, and behavior support so every pup gets a second chance.  
- **Rehome:** Matching dogs with families, and offering post-adoption guidance.

### How you can help

Your support fuels transport runs, medications, and safe shelter. Every peso stretches into food, bandages, and the time needed for scared dogs to heal.
